# Cursor Rules for Odoo Docker Project

## Directory Navigation Rule

- **ALWAYS use full absolute paths** when entering directories in terminal commands
- **NEVER use relative paths** like `cd odoo-project` or `cd ../some-dir`
- **ALWAYS use absolute paths** like `cd /Users/luisalejandro/Development/debt-collectors/odoo-project`

## Examples

✅ CORRECT:

- `cd /Users/luisalejandro/Development/debt-collectors/odoo-project`
- `cd /Users/luisalejandro/Development/debt-collectors/odoo-project/config`
- `cd /Users/luisalejandro/Development/debt-collectors/odoo-project/custom_addons`

❌ INCORRECT:

- `cd odoo-project`
- `cd ../odoo-project`
- `cd config`
- `cd ./custom_addons`

## Project Structure Paths

- **Root**: `/Users/luisalejandro/Development/debt-collectors`
- **Odoo Project**: `/Users/luisalejandro/Development/debt-collectors/odoo-project`
- **Config**: `/Users/luisalejandro/Development/debt-collectors/odoo-project/config`
- **Custom Addons**: `/Users/luisalejandro/Development/debt-collectors/odoo-project/custom_addons`
- **Backups**: `/Users/luisalejandro/Development/debt-collectors/odoo-project/backups`
- **Logs**: `/Users/luisalejandro/Development/debt-collectors/odoo-project/logs`
- **Scripts**: `/Users/luisalejandro/Development/debt-collectors/odoo-project/scripts`

## Why This Rule

- Ensures consistency across all terminal operations
- Prevents confusion about current working directory
- Makes commands more explicit and traceable
- Reduces errors from relative path assumptions

## This rule applies to ALL commands that involve directory navigation

- `cd` commands
- `mkdir` commands with path specifications
- File operations with directory paths
- Docker commands with volume mounts
- Git operations in specific directories
