# GitHub Actions Workflow for Agoras v2.0 (Multi-Package)
# This workflow runs on every push to master/develop
#
# Responsibilities:
# 1. Run linting
# 2. Run unit tests with coverage
# 3. Run integration tests
# 4. Aggregate coverage
#
# Publishing to PyPI is handled by release.yml when a GitHub release is created
